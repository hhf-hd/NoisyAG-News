Indeed, unless they buy a ""large quantity"" of emissions credits from other countries, they're not going to be able to meet their commitment at all.     Taishi Sugiyama, a climate expert at the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry in Japan, said emissions were rising 1 per cent a year due to a larger-than-expected impact from vehicles and households. That made it impossible to cut real domestic emissions by the required 16 per cent within a few years, he said.      Is this the last nail in the coffin for the Kyoto protocol?
